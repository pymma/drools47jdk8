	This package contains server side code for
	the repository. This is to implement the RPC needs for the GWT based front end,
	and application layer logic that uses the drools-repository back end (as a dependency).
	
	The client package contains code that is used by GWT entirely in the front end (ie
	it will be compiled to Javascript).
