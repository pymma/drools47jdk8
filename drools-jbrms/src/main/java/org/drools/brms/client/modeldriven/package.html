This is the model driven GUI builder.
This also includes a DSL aware editor.

The model package contains the model that drives the UI state. 

The SuggestionCompletionEngine provides the drop downs and suggestions etc.
That engine would be populated based on the information from the server side (eg package info, 
imports).
But we also need to know the bound variables.
